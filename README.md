## Overview

Senator Assembly is a multi-agent system that simulates the legislative processes of the United States Senate. The system creates artificial intelligence agents representing the political ideologies, backgrounds, and voting patterns of all 100 current United States Senators. Through concurrent execution and procedural modeling, the framework enables analysis of legislative decision-making processes, partisan dynamics, and policy formulation within the American bicameral legislature.

## Research Context

### Theoretical Foundation

The Senator Assembly framework addresses questions in political science and computational social science:

- **Agent-Based Modeling of Democratic Institutions**: How can computational models represent legislative behavior?
- **Ideological Scaling and Representation**: What methodologies capture the multidimensional nature of political ideology?
- **Procedural Realism in Simulation**: How can we model parliamentary procedures and rules?

### Literature Review

This work builds upon established research in:

1. **Computational Political Science**
   - Agent-based modeling of legislative processes (Laver & Sergenti, 2012)
   - Machine learning approaches to ideological scaling (Poole & Rosenthal, 1997)
   - Network analysis of legislative relationships (Porter et al., 2005)

2. **Multi-Agent Systems**
   - Concurrent execution frameworks for social simulation (Gilbert, 2008)
   - Large language models in behavioral simulation (Park et al., 2023)
   - Procedural modeling in institutional analysis (Jones & Baumgartner, 2005)

### Research Objectives

1. **Authentic Representation**: Develop computational models of individual senators
2. **Procedural Fidelity**: Implement Senate Rules and procedures
3. **Scalable Simulation**: Enable large-scale legislative simulations
4. **Analytical Depth**: Provide analytical tools for legislative behavior

## Core Architecture


## Usage

```python
from swarms.sims.senator_assembly import SenatorAssembly


def main():
    senator_simulation = SenatorAssembly(
        model_name="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
    )
    senator_simulation.simulate_vote_concurrent(
        (
            "A bill proposing a significant reduction in federal income tax rates for all American citizens. "
            "The legislation aims to lower tax brackets across the board, increase the standard deduction, "
            "and provide additional tax relief for middle- and lower-income families. Proponents argue that "
            "the bill will stimulate economic growth, increase disposable income, and enhance consumer spending. "
            "Opponents raise concerns about the potential impact on the federal deficit, funding for public services, "
            "and long-term fiscal responsibility. Senators must weigh the economic, social, and budgetary implications "
            "before casting their votes."
        ),
        batch_size=10,
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```



### Agent Architecture

Each senator agent is constructed using a multi-layered approach:

```python
@dataclass
class SenatorAgentConfiguration:
    identity_layer: Dict[str, Any]        # Biographical and background data
    ideological_layer: Dict[str, Any]     # Political positions and voting patterns
    procedural_layer: Dict[str, Any]      # Committee assignments and procedural knowledge
    interaction_layer: Dict[str, Any]     # Communication patterns and rhetorical style
```

#### Identity Layer Components
- **Biographical Data**: Professional background, education, career trajectory
- **Geographic Representation**: State-specific interests and regional priorities
- **Institutional Experience**: Committee assignments and legislative expertise

#### Ideological Layer Components
- **Core Principles**: Political philosophy and value system
- **Policy Positions**: Specific stances on key legislative issues
- **Voting Patterns**: Historical voting behavior and consistency metrics

---

## Methodological Framework

### Agent Development Methodology

#### Phase 1: Data Collection and Analysis
1. **Biographical Research**: Analysis of each senator's background
2. **Voting Record Analysis**: Assessment of legislative voting patterns
3. **Rhetorical Pattern Recognition**: Analysis of public statements and communications
4. **Committee Participation Review**: Assessment of legislative committee involvement

#### Phase 2: Prompt Engineering
1. **System Prompt Development**: Creation of ideology-specific system prompts
2. **Behavioral Calibration**: Refinement based on historical data

### Concurrent Execution Strategy

The framework implements a concurrent processing architecture:

```python
async def execute_legislative_vote(
    agents: List[SenatorAgent],
    bill_text: str,
    batch_size: int = 10
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Execute concurrent vote simulation with batch processing.

    Parameters:
    - agents: List of senator agents participating in vote
    - bill_text: Complete legislative proposal text
    - batch_size: Optimal batch size for concurrent execution

    Returns:
    - Comprehensive vote results and analysis
    """
